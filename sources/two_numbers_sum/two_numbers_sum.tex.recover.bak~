\chapter{Two numbers sum problem}

\section*{Introduction}
This problem is used often as a interview question and it is mostly asked during the early online stages of the hiring process because it is easy to explain, to understand and its solution fits in a few lines. This is a great question because it allows you to clearly show to the interviewer your thought process and how you can incrementally improve and refine your solution until it reaches the optimum.


\section{Problem statement}

\begin{exercise}
Write a function that takes a collection of integers and a number $T$, and return \textbf{true} if the sum of two distinct elements of the collection is equal to $T$, \textbf{false} otherwise.
\end{exercise}



\begin{example}
\\ \hfill
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[] 	$A=\{9, 4, 17, 42, 36, -3 ,15}\}$
		\item[] 	$T = 14$
	\end{itemize}
The answer in this case is \textbf{true} because elements we can obtain $14=17+ (-3)$. 
If $T=17$ then the answer would be \textbf{false} as there is no way we can sum two numbers together and obtain $17$
\end{example}

More formally, what the problem asks is:
\begin{exercise}
	Given an array $A=\{a1...an\}$ and $T$, where $a_i, T \in \mathcal{N}$, return:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] \textbf{true }if $\exists \;i,j \: i \neq j$ s.t. $a_i+a_j = T$
		\item[-] \textbf{false} otherwise
	\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}	
	

\section{Clarification Questions}
What are the questions that are good to ask?
List a number of relevant question and for each of them give a possible answer from the interview

- What is the size of the input?
- Is the collection sorted?
- Are duplicates allowed?
