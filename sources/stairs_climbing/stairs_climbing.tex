\chapter{Climb the Stairs}
\label{ch:stairs_climbing}
\section*{Introduction}
This chapter deals with a classic problem often set during the interview process for big tech companies like Amazon or Google. It also shares the same underlying structure, key properties and solutions as many other standard interview problems (for example, the coin change problem in Chapter X) and therefore we can apply the techniques discussed in this chapter to all question where the problem statement is structured: \textit{Given a target find minimum (maximum) cost / path / sum to reach the target}.  

The basic approach to solving this problem is problem: \textit{Choose minimum/maximum path among all possible paths before the current state, then add the value for the current state.} but we will examine this in more detail in order to clarify what is meant by words such as \quotes{current} and \quotes{state} and also address a common variation on the problem. 

\section{Problem statement}
\label{sec:stairs_climbing_statement_easy}
\begin{exercise}
You are climbing a stair case and it takes $n$ steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb $1$ or $2$ steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?


\begin{example}
	\hfill \\ 
	Given $n = 3$ the answer is $3$ because there are three ways (See Figure \ref{fig:stair_example_3} to climb to the top of the stairs:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $1$ step + $1$ step + $1$ step
		\item $1$ step + $2$ steps
		\item $2$ steps + $1$ step
	\end{enumerate}
	

	
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	\hfill \\
	Given $n = 4$ the answer is $5$ because there are five ways (See Figure \ref{fig:stair_example_5} to climb to the top of the stairs:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $1$ step + $1$ step + $1$ step + $1$ step
		\item $2$ steps + $1$ step + $1$ step
		\item $1$ step + $1$ step + $2$ steps 
		\item $1$ step + $2$ steps + $1$ step
		\item $2$ steps +  $2$ steps
	\end{enumerate}
	
	
\end{example}
\end{exercise}

\section{Clarification Questions}

\begin{QandA}
	\item \begin{questionitem} \begin{question} Can the size of the staircase be zero?  \end{question} 	 
    \begin{answered}
		\textit{Yes, the staircase can be made of zero steps.}
	\end{answered} \end{questionitem}
	
	\item \begin{questionitem} \begin{question} It is guaranteed that the answer will fit a built-in integer?  \end{question} 	 
    \begin{answered}
		\textit{Yes, do not worry about overflow.}
	\end{answered} \end{questionitem}

\end{QandA}

\section{Discussion}
\label{stairs_climbing:sec:discussion}

First, let's examine a few examples in order to identify the relevant patterns. Table \ref{tab:stairs_climbing_ways_up_tp_7} shows  how many ways there are to climb a stair of lenght $n$ up to $n=7$.

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		$n$ & \textbf{Ways} \\ \hline
		$0$ & $0$ \\ \hline
		$1$ & $1$ \\ \hline
		$2$ & $2$ \\ \hline
		$3$ & $3$ \\ \hline
		$4$ & $5$ \\ \hline
		$5$ & $8$ \\ \hline
		$6$ & $13$ \\ \hline
		$7$ & $21$ \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\label{tab:stairs_climbing_ways_up_tp_7}
\caption{All the ways to climb a stair of length $n \leq 7$ }
\end{table}

Looking at the table one thing should be immediately apparent: the number of ways to climb the stair of size $n$ is equal to the $n^th$ element of the \textbf{Fibonacci} sequence (starting with two $1$).
Once that is clear then the solution is straightforward as shown in Listing \ref{list:stairs_climbing_fibonacci}.

\lstinputlisting[language=c++, caption=Solution to the stairs climbining problem with steps of size $1$ and $2$ using Fibonacci.,label=list:stairs_climbing_fibonacci]{sources/stairs_climbing/stairs_climbing_solution1.cpp}

Now, let's have a look at why the seemingly unrelated fibonacci sequence plays a role in this problem. If the problem is looked at as an iterative process in which at each step a certain number of stairs are climbed. For instance if $n = 3$ and:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[-] $1$ step is hopped then the number of remaining steps is $3-1 = 2$. 
	\item[-] $2$ steps are hopped then the number of remaining steps is $3-2 = 1$.
\end{itemize}
When one step is hopped, the problem changes from climbing $n$ stairs to $n-1$ stairs. At this point the problem is seemingly unchanged except for the number of stairs left to climb and the same reasoning can be applied again:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[-] $1$ step is hopped then the number of remaining steps is $(n-1)-1 = n-2$. 
	\item[-] $2$ steps are hopped then the number of remaining steps is $(n-1)-2 = (n-3)$.
\end{itemize}
As can be seen, two decisions are possible i.e. climbing one or two stairs, exactly as in the fibonacci sequence, until either the $n$ step or a point past it is reached.

\section{Common Variation
}
\subsection{Arbitrary step lengths}
\label{stairs_climbing:sec:arbitrary_steps}
What happens when the step sizes allowed are not just $1$ or $2$ but an array of $k$ positive values $A=\{s_1 < s_2 < \ldots < s_k\}$. The problem statement for this harder variant is as follows:

\begin{exercise}
You are climbing a stair case and it takes $n$ steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb $s_1$ or $s_2$ or $\ldots$ or $s_k$ steps where $0 < s_1 < s_2 < \ldots < s_k$. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
\end{exercise}

The solution to this problem variant is equivalent to the easier version described in Section \ref{sec:stairs_climbing_statement_easy} when the allowed step sizes are $s_i = 1$ and $s_2=2$.
