  abstract  = {A new algorithm is presented for determining which, if any, of an arbitrary number of candidates has received a majority of the votes cast in an election. The number of comparisons required is at most twice the number of votes. Furthermore, the algorithm uses storage in a way that permits an efficient use of magnetic tape. A Fortran version of the algorithm is exhibited. The Fortran code has been proved correct by a mechanical verification system for Fortran. The system and the proof are discussed.},
