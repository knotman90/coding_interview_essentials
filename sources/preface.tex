\chapter*{Preface}
Landing a lucrative job as a software engineer at FAANG companies is becoming harder and harder every day. It is not uncommon to have to go through and nail 5 or more technical rounds where you are asked to solve difficult problems on the spot.
One of the most common interview preparation strategies is to binge code on the many online coding platforms available.

This approach can be effective to some extent but it is not optimal as most of the time the quality of the resources on these websites is not good or accurate enough to promote healthy learning that sticks with you for a long time and that can be applied during the stressful moments of the interview.

This is why I have decided to take things in my hand and during the last couple of years, I have studied the most common problems and selected a subset of them whose solutions will allow you to tackle a very wide range of question types. The result is distilled into bite-sized quality lessons telling you everything you need to know about a problem.
