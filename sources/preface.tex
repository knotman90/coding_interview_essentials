Landing a lucrative job as a software engineer at FAANG is an increasingly competitive endeavour. It is not uncommon to have to go through and impress in 5 or more technical rounds, each of which will require you to solve complex coding problems in a high pressure environment. 

A common preparation strategy is to binge code on one of the many online coding platforms that cater to this need. This however, is not the optimal approach as the quality of the resources on these websites is insufficiently high or consistent to ensure the solid grasp of solution fundamentals needed to quickly adapt to the specifics of any question that may come up in real life.

For this reason, I have decided to take a different approach and, having spent several years studying the most common interview problems based on surveys from candidates, I have complied a subset of problems whose solutions can be applied across a broad array of actual interview questions. These problems and their solutions are presented in bite-sized quality lessons which will hopefully provide you with the tools you need to go on and succeed at interview.
