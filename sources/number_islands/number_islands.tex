\chapter{Count the number of islands}
\label{ch:number_islands}
In this chapter we will discuss a classic interview problem question which requires that we
count the number of islands on a map provided as a 2D boolean matrix. There are many
versions of the statements for this problem, some with a wordy and playful background
story and others where the map is just given to you as graph of some sort. Thankfully all the
versions can be solved with the approaches below which  are based on standard graph visiting algorithms.

\section{Problem statement}
\begin{exercise}
Write a function that given a $2$D boolean matrix counts the number of islands in the grid. Cells in
the input matrix containing a $1$ represent land while $0$  water. An island is a group of adjacent
land cells. Every cell in the input matrix can be adjacent to the $4$ cells that are next to it on
the same row or column.

The input grid is a 2D \inline{std::vector<std::vector<bool>>} of size $n\times m$. 
	\begin{example}
		\hfill \\
		Given the following input grid (depicted in Figure \ref{fig:number_islands:example1}) the
		function returns $4$. The text representation of this example is given below where $1$
		represents land, and a $0$ water:	
	\begin{verbatim}
	1110000
	0100000
	0110110
	0010110
	0100000
	0110010
	0011000
	\end{verbatim}
	\end{example}

\end{exercise}

\section{Clarification Questions}

\begin{QandA}
	\item \begin{questionitem} \begin{question} Can $n$ or $m$ be $0$?  \end{question} 	 
    \begin{answered}
		\textit{Yes, the map can be empty}
	\end{answered} \end{questionitem}
	\item \begin{questionitem} \begin{question} Can the input grid be modified?  \end{question} 	 
    \begin{answered}
		\textit{Yes, the input matrix is not read-only.}

\section{Discussion}
\label{number_islands:sec:discussion}
Essentially, what  this problem is asking us to do is identify the number of clusters of $1$s in the input matrix.
One way to do this is by looping through the map one cell at a time until we find a $1$, let's say at cell $(i,j)$.
Because this particular $1$ must be part of an island, what we can then do is start exploring the island
one cell at a time, moving from a $1$ to an adjacent one, until there are no $1$s we have not already visited.
When we visit a land cell we mark it as "visited".
This is useful because when we resume our normal linear scanning of the map we want to make
sure we do not count the visited cells as being the starting point of an uncounted island.
For instance in the example in Figure \ref{fig:number_islands:example1} we can start our visit
at cell $(0,0)$ which is a $1$ and is not yet visited. This means that this particular cell is
part of an island that we did not count yet. At this point we can start visiting the cells adjacent
to $(0,0)$ i.e. cells: $(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)$. When a cell is visited it is
marked as shown in Figure  \ref{fig:number_islands:visited} by the red cross
\textcolor[HTML]{860000}{$\times$} and after that all of its neighboring land cell are visited similarly in a recursive manner.
When we have exhausted all the cells of the island $(0,0)$ is part of we can resume our linear search remembering we have explored an additional island.

The visit can be performed using a BFS or DFS approach. In the following section we will look at a
recursive and iterative implementation of the DFS approach. We prefer the DFS approach over BSF mostly because it is easier to 
code recursively.
The iterative version (in Listing \ref{sec:num_island:recursive}) can, however,  be turned
into a BFS quite easily just  by changing the policy of the order in which cells are to be visited.


\subsubsection{DFS iterative}
\label{sec:num_island:iterative}
Listing \ref{list:number_islands:iterative} shows a possible iterative implementation of the DFS
approach as described above. Note that the core of the algorithm is the function \inline{visit} that
uses a stack to keep track of the cells that are still to be visited. For each cell that is actually
visited we will also try to visit all pieces of yet unvisited land in all four directions (up, down,
left and right). We do this by adding them to the pile of cells to be visited. When a cell is actually
visited, it is marked as such in its corresponding cell of the array \inline{visited}.
When there is no  more land left in the stack it means that the island has been completely visited 
and we can return. Once it is complete its execution function \inline{visit}
returns the control back in the double loop of the function \inline{count_island_iterative_DFS} which will skip all the
visited cells and will trigger another invocation of \inline{visit} as soon as another unvisited $1$ cell is
found. That $1$ has to be part of a not yet unaccounted island together with all its adjacents land cells.

Also please note how the if at line $22$ takes care of not visiting cells that are outside the
boundaries of the map, cells that are not land or already visited because this would lead to
out-of-bound errors, incorrect results and infinite loops, respectively.

The complexity of this implementation in Listing \ref{list:number_islands:iterative} is 
$O(n\times m)$ for both time and space 
because we visit the whole map at least once and we use space proportional to $n\times m$
for the array \inline{visited}.

Do we, however,  really need to have a dedicated matrix just to store the information about which cell is visited?
In fact no, as we can store that information in-place in the input matrix. All we have to do when marking a cell visited is turn
the value in the input grid (which is modifiable) for that cell from land ($1$) to water ($0$) meaning that cell can never be considered as part
of an island in the future. If we do that, the space complexity does not change because we still use
space to store the cells to be visited in the stack,
but the amount of space used will be lower in practice and the overall solution will look cleaner and simpler which is always a plus during an
interview.

\subsubsection{DFS recursive}
\label{sec:num_island:recursive}
The same idea can be implemented recursively which, in our opinion,  makes the
overall implementation more expressive, shorter and easier to reason about as well as to explain.  As such, our first choice is always to
use this approach if possible when dealing with problems similar to the one presented here.
Listing \ref{list:number_islands:recursive} shows a possible implementation of a recursive DFS solution for
this problem. 
Note that the recursion only happens during the DFS itself and that the driver
function \inline{count_island_recursive_DFS} is basically the same as the ones shown in the
previous two solutions \ref{list:number_islands:iterative} and
\ref{list:number_islands:iterative_1}.
