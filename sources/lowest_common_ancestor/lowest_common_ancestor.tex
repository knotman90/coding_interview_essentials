\chapter{Lowest Common Ancestor for BST}
\label{ch:lowest_common_ancestor}
\section*{Introduction}
The lowest common ancestor is an important concept in graph theory and it is
quite often a topic or a fundamental building block of coding interview questions.
Given a tree and two nodes $p$ and $q$, the lowest common ancestor  of $p$ and $q$, ($LCA(p,q)$) is defined as the lowest or deepest node that has both $p$ and $q$ as descendant.
In other words the LCA is the shared ancestor or $p$ and $q$ that is the farthest from the root of the tree.

In this chapter we will explore the problem of finding the LCA for a tree of a particular kind: binary search. This constraint simplify the general problem of finding LCA greatly. 
\section{Problem statement}
\begin{exercise}
	Write a function that takes a binary search tree $T$, and two nodes $p$ and $q$ and returns their lowest common ancestor.

	\begin{example}
		\hfill \\
		Given the tree in Figure \ref{fig:lowest_common_ancestor:example1} the lowest common ancestor for nodes:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $p = 2$, $q=12$ is node $3$
			\item $p = 12$, $q=3$ is node $12$
			\item $p = 18$, $q=1$ is the root node $13$
		\end{itemize}
		\label{ex:lower_common_ancestor:example1}
	\end{example}
\end{exercise}
