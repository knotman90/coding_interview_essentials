\chapter{Reverse a singly linked list}
\label{ch:list_reverse}

\section*{Introduction}
In this chapter we are going to have a look at a problem that is about reversing a singly linked list.
This problem has been asked in coding interviews for a long
time. and despite the fact it is among the most basic problems on linked-list out there and despite its popularity
and the fact it is about one of the basic fundamental data structures in computer science, it has
been proven to be the cause of failure for many software engineers interview. Most often, being unable to solve these
problems result in almost immediate rejection.

The problem has  a simple definition as it asks us to transform a given list into its reverse.
We will discuss how we can approach this problem both in a recursive as well as in an iterative
manner. Section \ref{sec:list_reverse:statement} will present the formal problem statement and the subsequent sections 
discuss the details of the solution. Finally in Section \ref{sec:list_reverse:hard} we will have a look at the slightly harder variation that if
often asked as a follow-up and which solution is left as an exercices.


\section{Problem statement}
\begin{exercise}
Create a function that given a singly linked list $L$, reverses it and return the pointer to the new
head of $L$. $L$ is given as a pointer to the first node of the list. The definition of the node is
given in Listing \ref{list:list_reverse:node_definition}.



\begin{example}
	\hfill \\
	Given the $L = 1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 5$, the function modifies
	it into $L = 5 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1$ and returns a pointer to
	the node $5$, the new head of the list.
\end{example}

\end{exercise}

\section{Clarification Questions}

\begin{QandA}
	\item Can the input list be empty? 
	\begin{answered}
		\textit{Yes.}
	\end{answered}

	\item Can I assume $L$ is not corrupted by for instance containing cycles? 
	\begin{answered}
		\textit{Yes, the input list is a singly linked list with no cycles.}
	\end{answered}
	
\end{QandA}

\section{Discussion}
\label{list_reverse:sec:discussion}
Solving this problem by using linear additional space is  trivial as we can iterate over the list
and for each push the address of each of its nodes in a stack. We can then, pop them one at a time
while making sure they are connected in the same order they are popped-out. Listing
\ref{list:list_reverse:stack} shows a possible implementation of this idea. The time and space
complexity of this approach is $O(n)$.

\lstinputlisting[language=c++, caption={Linear time and space complexity solution using a stack to reverse the nodes in the list.},label=list:list_reverse:stack]{/home/dspataro/git/algorithm_articles/sources/list_reverse/list_reverse_solution1.cpp}

We can however avoid using additional space in the form of a \inline{std::stack} and rely on the
implicit stack we get when we perform recursive calls. In order to take advantage of it, it is
convenient however, to shift our view of the problem and see it as follows. Imagine we have a list
such that it is already reversed after its $k^{th}$ node. How can we then reverse the rest of it?
Let's have a look at Figure \ref{fig:list_reverse:list_reverse_recursive_intermediate} depicting
this scenario where $k=4$. As you can see the list is already reversed from node $5$ onwards and all
we have to do if to have it pointing to node $4$ and make $4$ points to nothing. More generically
what we want to achieve is to make the node $k+1$ ($L_{k+1}$) point to the node $k$ ($L_{k+1}$). We
can achieve that by doing: $L_{k} \rightarrow next \rightarrow next= L_{k}(L_{k+1}$). W.r.t. Figure
\ref{fig:list_reverse:list_reverse_recursive_intermediate} $L_{k} \rightarrow next$ is $5$ and
$L_{k} \rightarrow next$ is pointing to nothing. After these operations what we are left with the
list  shown in Figure \ref{fig:list_reverse:list_reverse_recursive_intermediate1}. If we do that for
each of the nodes eventually we are left with a reversed list.

	\caption[]{Nodes arrangements after performing the recursive call for node $5$.}
	\label{fig:list_reverse:list_reverse_recursive_intermediate1}
	 \end{subfigure}
\end{figure}
But what about the new head of the list? What should each recursive call return? This is actually
pretty simple. Whenever we reach the end of the list\footnote{Which is when either the current node
is null or the current node does not have any node next to it.} we return the current node, which is
effectively the new head of the reversed list, and we keep propagating that value for all the
recursive calls. 

To summarise, for each recursive call we first reverse the rest of the list and we get back the head
of the reversed list. We can now take care of reversing the link from the current node to the next
and return the head we got back from the recursive call. Listing \ref{list:list_reverse:recursive}
shows a possible implementation of this idea. Notice that despite this solution does not explicitly
use any additional space, it still requires spaces for the activation frames of all the recursive
calls. Therefore its complexity remains equivalent to the one of Listing \ref{list:list_reverse:stack}.

\subsection{Constant space}
It is impossible to solve this problem faster than linear time as each node needs accessed at least
once, but we can bring the space complexity down to constant, by reversing the list two nodes at a
time from the head to the tail. Assuming $L$ has at least two nodes (if not we are in a trivial case
in which the list is already reversed and $L$ is also the head of the reversed list) then we can
always maintain two pointers to the current element \inline{curr}and its next \inline{curr\_next}. We know that
\inline{curr}points to \inline{curr\_next} but what we really want to achieve is \inline{curr\_next} pointing to $curr$.
We can take care of that and proceed with moving curr and \inline{curr\_next} forward and repeat the process.
Eventually we will have reversed all nodes in the list. This process ends whenever we reach the last
of the list, which also happen to be the new head of the list.

An implementation of such idea is shown in Listing \ref{list:list_reverse:constant_space}. Notice
that while making \inline{curr\_next} point to \inline{curr}we also need to remember the element
\inline{curr\_next} points to, otherwise it would be impossible to move \inline{curr} and
\inline{curr\_next} forward.
Figure \ref{fig:list_reverse:list_reverse_iterative_execution} shows the execution of the algorithm in Listing \ref{list:list_reverse:constant_space} on a list of $7$ elements.

\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter we discussed three possible approaches to the problem of reversing a singly-linked list.
We saw that it is almost trivial when using an iterative approach together with a stack to store the addressed of the list's nodes. 
This approach is based on the fact that the ordering of $n$  elements popped from a stack is the reverse of the ordering the elements have been pushed onto.

We then had a look at an alternative solution that is somehow based on the same stack idea, whereas this time we did not use an explicit stack to store the nodes, but we have somehow stored the same information in the 
call stack of the recursive function. 

Lastly we discussed a solution where only a constant space is required. This approach works iteratively from the head to the tail of the list by reversing two nodes at a time.

\section{Common variation - Reserve a sublist}
\subsection{Problem statement}
\begin{exercise}
Create a function that given a singly linked list $L$ and two integers $n \geq  m \geq 0$,
reverses only its nodes from the $m^{th}$ to the $n^{th}$ and return the pointer to the new
head of $L$. As in the other version of this problem discussed above the definition of a node is the same and the list 
$L$ is given as a pointer to the first node of the list itself.

\begin{example}
	\hfill \\
	Given the $L = 1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 5$, $m = 3$, $n = 5$ the function modifies
	it into $L = 1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 3$ and returns a pointer to
	the node $1$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	\hfill \\
	Given the $L = 1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 5$, $m = 1$, $n = 2$ the function modifies
	it into $L = 1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 3$ and returns a pointer to
	the node $1$.
\end{example}

\end{exercise}
