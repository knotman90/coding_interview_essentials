\chapter{Sort the chunks, sort the array.}
\label{ch:max_num_chunks_sorted}
\section*{Introduction}

Sorting is a popular topic in computer science and in programming interviews. 
Its usefulness its beyond dispute and is it not surprising that there are literally
countless of research papers and algorithms on the topic. 

In this problem however we are not going to devise a novel sorting algorithm, instead 
will investigate how we can sort an entire array by sorting a number of its individual sub-arrays.
The idea is that we would like to know how we can split an array into pieces such that if each of the pieces is sorted 
individually then the final result would be equivalent to having sorted the entire array to begin with.

It is necessary to develop a key insight to solve this problem efficiently, 
and asking the right questions and looking at a number of good examples
is fundamental for doing so. In the next section we are going to explore how these insights 
can be gained and then turned into an efficient code. 

\section{Problem statement}
\begin{exercise}
\label{example:max_num_chunks_sorted:exercice1}
Write a function that given an array $I$ of integers returns the maximum number of sub-arrays (or chunks) of $I$ 
such that if each of the sub-array is sorted individually, then $I$ as a whole is sorted.

	%example1
	\begin{example}
		\label{example:max_num_chunks_sorted:example1}
		\hfill \\
		Given $I=\{45,88,1,9,90\}$ then the function return $1$.
		
	\end{example}

	%example2
	\begin{example}
		\label{example:max_num_chunks_sorted:example2}
		\hfill \\
		Given $I=\{4,3,2,1,5,9,10\}$ then the function return $4$. We can sort the following sub-arrays:
		\begin{itemize*}
			\item $[0,3]$
			\item $[4,4]$
			\item $[4,4]$
			\item $[4,4]$
		\end{itemize*}
	\end{example}
\end{exercise}

\section{Clarification Questions}

\begin{QandA}
	\item Can the chunks overlap? 
	\begin{answered}
		\textit{No. If you choose to sort two sub-arrays of $I$ $s_1=[p,q], p\leq q$ and $s_2=[x,y], x\leq y$ then either $x > q$ or $p>y$.}
	\end{answered}
	
\end{QandA}

\section{Discussion}
\label{max_num_chunks_sorted:sec:discussion}

\section{Brute-force}
\label{max_num_chunks_sorted:sec:bruteforce}


Let's start our discussion by thinking about a brute-force solution for this problem. 
One possible way of doing it would be to try to divide the array into $|I|$ non-empty and non-overlapping parts (only one way of performing such division), 
sort  them individually and then check if $I$ is sorted. 
If it is not, then we can try to divide $I$ into $|I|-1$ sub-arrays,
and check whether by sorting the resulting individual pieces $I$ turns to be sorted.
This line or reasoning can be generalized and a general brute-force approach
that works by progressively trying to split $I$ into less and less number of sub-arrays $k <|I|$.
For each of the possible valid divisions of $I$ into $k$ sub-arrays, we can then check whether 
we can obtain a complete sorting of $I$ by only sorting the individual $k$ sub-arrays.
Eventually when $k=1$, $I$ would be sorted fully as this is equivalent to sorting $I$ entirely.

Clearly this algorithm is complete and correct
as all possible valid partitions of $I$ are checked. Its complexity is however exponential
in time as given a certain $k$ there are ${n \choose k} $ possible way we can divide $I$ into $k$ sub-arrays. 
Listing \ref{list:max_num_chunks_sorted:bruteforce} shows a C++ implementation of such idea.

\end{minipage}


\section{Linear time}
\label{max_num_chunks_sorted:sec:lineartime}
This problem can be however sorted in linear time if we take into consideration that if we sort a sub-array of $I$
containing elements from index $s$ to $r< |I|-1$  (there is at least an element after this sub-array) 
then $I$ cannot be fully sorted if the maximum element among the elements $I_s, I_{s+1},\ldots, I_r$
is smaller than any of the element of $I$ after $r$ (or smaller than the smallest among those elements after $r$). 
For instance, imagine $I$ is the input array of the example \ref{example:max_num_chunks_sorted:example2}. 
If we choose $s=0$ and $r=2$ then $I$ can never be properly sorted, no matter how we divide the elements after the one at index $r=2$ into subarrays
because the element at index $3$ will always appear after the value $4$ (see Figure \ref{fig:max_num_chunks_sorted:example1}).

\begin{figure}[b]
  \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sources/max_num_chunks_sorted/images/example1}
   \caption[]{Input array from the Example \ref{example:max_num_chunks_sorted:example1}. If the 
   sub-array identified by $s$ and $r$ is sorted in isolation, $I$ as a whole cannot be sorted (no matter how elements from $r$ to $|I|-1$ are sorted)
   because $M$ will always appear before $m$, despite the fact $M>m$ and it should appear after.}.
   \label{fig:max_num_chunks_sorted:example1}
\end{figure}

This insight makes possible to derive a greedy approach to this problem that is based on the idea that we 
are going to split $I$ into as many pieces as possible, such that the largest element of a sub-array 
is smaller than all the subsequent elements. 

Listing \ref{list:max_num_chunks_sorted:linear} shows an implementation of this  idea that works by keeping a sorted list $N$
of all the elements not yet processed in $I$. $N$ initially contains all the values in $I$.
We start a new chunk at index $0$ and we keep including elements into this chunk until the largest
of its element is still larger than the smallest element in $N$.
When an element is included into the chunk, then it is removed from $N$.
If the largest element in the current chunk is indeed smaller than the smallest in $N$,
then this signals the fact we can sort this chunk independently without
causing $I$ as a whole not to be sorted (all the element of this chunk appear before the rest of the elements when $I$ is sorted).
At this point we can start a new chunk and repeat the process until
we are left with no element to process (or equivalently $N$ is empty).
Listing \ref{list:max_num_chunks_sorted:linear} has a complexity of $O(|I|)$  for both space and time.
