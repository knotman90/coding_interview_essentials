\chapter{N-Queens}
\label{ch:nqueens}
\section*{Introduction}
In this chapter we are going to discuss a problem that is more known because of one of its
specialization, namely the eight queen puzzle where you are challenged with the problem of placing
eight chess queens on an $8 \times 8$ chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other
requiring, therefore that no two queens share the same row, column or diagonal.

The n-queens is a classical and old problem which is used as an example of a simple but definitely
non-trivial problem for various programming techniques such as constraint programming, logic
programming , recursion and even genetic algorithms. In the context of a programming interview, you
should aim for precision and for outlining the solution strategy clearly while solving it. The
interview is very likely expecting you to be comfortable with the problem already, and possibly with
the solution but he want to see how well you can explain and materialize into code all the steps
that are in between a purely brute-force and a more sophisticated solution.

\section{Problem statement}
\begin{exercise}
\label{example:nqueens:exercice1}
The $n$-queens puzzle is the problem of placing $n$ queens on an $n \times n$ chessboard in such a
way that no two queens can attack each other. A queen can attach any piece along its row, column or
diagonals. Write a function that given an integer $1 \leq n$, returns all solutions to the
$n$-queens puzzle.

A solution is to be returned as a snapshot of the chessboard. A snapshot of the board is an array of
$n$ strings, each representing a row, where an empty cell is denoted by the symbol '.' and a cell
occupied by a queen by the letter 'Q'.

For instance the snapshop of the board shown in Figure \ref{} is the following: 

	%example1
	\begin{example}
		\label{example:nqueens:example1}
		\hfill \\
		Given $n$ the function returns an array containing the following strings:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textit{"}
		\end{itemize}
		
	\end{example}

	%example2
	\begin{example}
		\label{example:nqueens:example2}
		\hfill \
