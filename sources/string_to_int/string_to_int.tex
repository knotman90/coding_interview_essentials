\chapter{String to Integer}
\label{ch:string_to_int}
\section*{Introduction}
The problem discussed in this chapter is an extremely popular warm-up question asked during the onsite interview as well as part of many online assessment exercices. It is important to ask the right questions to the interview so to make sure that the problem is understood well and that all the corner cases are handled properly. For instance the interviewer might ask  to take car care of negative numbers, but that might not be explicitly stated in the problem statement.

\section{Problem statement}
\begin{exercise}
Write a function that given a string $s$ containing only numbers (characters from [0-9]), parse it into its integer representation without using any library specific functions.
\end{exercise}


\begin{example}
	\hfill \\
	If $s$ ="12345", then the function should return the integer $12345$.	
\end{example}
