\chapter{Find the $K$ closest elements}
\label{ch:find_k_closest_in_array}
\section*{Introduction}
In this chapter we will discuss a problem that asks you to return a subset of a given input
array. We will investigate two solutions: one that is based on sorting and the other on binary
search with the latter being more efficient as we will make good use of the
fact that the input is provided already sorted. By contrast,  the solution based on
sorting appears almost trivial to and we can derive it directly from the problem
statement while the solution based on binary search requires slightly more insight and typing to
get right. We will present two different implementations of the binary search solution: 
\begin{enumerate*}
	\item the first based entirely the C++ STL,
	\item and the other where we will code the binary search algorithm explicitly. 
\end{enumerate*}

\section{Problem statement}
\begin{exercise}

	Write a function that takes as input
	\begin{itemize*}
		\item a sorted array $I$ and two integers
		\item $k$ and
		\item $x$,
	\end{itemize*}
	and returns an array, sorted in ascending order, containing the $k$ elements that are closest to
	$x$ in $I$. Note that: given two elements $y$, and $z$, $y$ is closer to $x$ than $z$ if:
	\begin{equation}
		|x-y| < |x-z|
	\label{eq:kclosest_in_array:sort_criteria}
	\end{equation}
	 

	\begin{example}
		\hfill \\
		Given
		\begin{itemize*}
			\item $I = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$,
			\item $k=4$ and
			\item $x=3$,
		\end{itemize*} 
		the function returns: $\{2,3,4,5\}$
	\end{example}

	\begin{example}
		\hfill \\
		Given
		\begin{itemize*}
			\item $I = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$,
			\item $k=4$ and
			\item $x=-1$,
		\end{itemize*} 
		the function returns: $\{1,2,3,4\}$
	\end{example}

	\begin{example}
		\hfill \\
		Given
		\begin{itemize*}
			\item $I = \{12,16,26,30,35,39,42,46,48,50,53,55,56\}$,
			\item $k=5$ and
			\item $x=36$,
		\end{itemize*} 
		 the function returns: $\{26,30,35,39,42\}$
	\end{example}
\end{exercise}

\section{Clarification Questions}

\begin{QandA}
	\item \item \begin{questionitem} \begin{question} What should the function behavior be when resolving ties? What should it do when you have two
	elements that are at the same distance from $x$? \end{question}
	\begin{answered}
		\textit{The function should always favor the smaller element in case of a tie.}
	\end{answered} \end{questionitem}
	
	\item \begin{questionitem} \begin{question} Is I guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order?  \end{question} 	 
    \begin{answered}
		\textit{Yes you can assume $I$ is always sorted in ascending order.}
	\end{answered} \end{questionitem}
	
\end{QandA}

\section{Sorting}
\label{sec:find_k_closest_in_array:sorting}
A solution that almost immediately follows from the problem statement is based on
sorting the elements of $I$ according to the criteria shown in Equation
\ref{eq:kclosest_in_array:sort_criteria}. The idea is that if $I$ is sorted according to the
absolute value of the difference between each number of $I$ and $x$ then the closest number to $x$
will be located after the sorting at the front of $I$. All that is necessary at that point is to copy
the first $K$ element of $I$ into the return array. Listing \ref{list:find_k_closest_in_array1}
shows a possible implementation of this idea. 
\lstinputlisting[language=c++, caption={Solution to the problem of finding the $k$ closest element using sorting.},label=list:find_k_closest_in_array1]{sources/find_k_closest_in_array/find_k_closest_in_array_solution1.cpp}

Please note that -  as in all cases where you actually do not need to have the whole array sorted  - you
can use partial sorting instead of fully-fledged sorting. In all cases where $k$ is smaller that
$n$ the complexity is going to be slightly better as we will go from the $O(nlog(n))$ of the normal
sorting to $O(nlog(k))$ of the partial sort. Fortunately, making this change in C++ is
easily as it is only a matter of calling \inline{std::partial_sort} instead of \inline{std::sort} as
shown in Listing \ref{list:find_k_closest_in_array2}.

\lstinputlisting[language=c++, caption={Solution to the problem of finding the $k$ closest element using sorting.},label=list:find_k_closest_in_array2]{sources/find_k_closest_in_array/find_k_closest_in_array_solution2.cpp}

\subsection{Binary Search}
\label{find_k_closest_in_array:sec:binary_search}
The problem description clearly states that the input array is sorted but the solution we
devised in Section \ref{sec:find_k_closest_in_array:sorting} does not take advantage of that fact.
 All it does is invalidate the original ordering in order to enforce a different one. Every time
the problem statement mentions that some input is sorted, we should think how to use that 
to devise a more efficient solution rather than questioning whether that information is useful or
not. It is always wise to assume that there will be no useless information in the problem statement. When sorted input is
involved, there are several algorithms that should immediately come to mind and, out  of this set, binary
search is probably first. All that is left is to ask ourselves how binary search could be applied to this
problem?

But first, let's take a step back and try to analyze the problem for a slightly different angle. Specifically,
let's discuss the case where $x \in \: I$. In this case we know for sure that $x$ is going to be
part of the output vector. As the input is sorted we can use binary search to search for $x$ in
$I$. Once we have identified the index $j$ such that $I_j = x$ we know that the closest element to
$x$ must either be at index $j+1$ or $j-1$ \footnote{If that was not true it would mean that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $I_k = I_{j+1}$. In this case, picking $K$  would not be an improvement to $j-1$ or $j+1$.
	\item otherwise either:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\exists k < j-1 \: : I_k < I_{j-1}$ and  $x-I_k < x-I_{j-1}$ or
		\item $\exists k > j+1 \: : I_k > I_{j+1}$ and  $I_k-x < I_{j+1}-x$ \end{itemize} which is
	impossible because the input is sorted. \end{itemize}}. Therefore once $x$ has been identified
	we can select a range of $k$ elements "centered" at $j$. Said range can be found by using a two
	pointers technique. We start by initializing two pointers $l = j$ and $r = j$. Then until $r-l+1
	< k$ we do one of the following operations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item if $l = 0$ then $r = r+1$
	\item if $r = |I|$ then $l = l-1$
	\item if$ x-I_{l-1} > I_{r+1}-x$ then $r = r+1$. The range is enlarged at its right end
	side.
	\item symmetrically for the left side: if $x-I_{l-1} > I_{r+1}-x$ then $ l + l+1$. The range is
	enlarged at its left end side.
\end{itemize}
In other words once $x$ has been found, we incrementally include elements around it by always
choosing between the closest numbers to $x$ between the numbers pointed by the two pointers.

This approach can easily be extended to the case where $x$ is not present in the input array as it
also works when we try to build the range of elements to be returned around the closest element to
$x$ in the array. 
Turns out that binary search can be used to find such an element (we even have STL
support for such an operation). 
In particular we can use it to identify the index of the first element that is larger or equal than $x$:
a value that is commonly known as \textit{lower bound}.
Armed with this information let's have a look at Listing \ref{list:find_k_closest_in_array3} showing
the implementation of the idea above where we use the STL \inline{std::lower\_bound} function to find
the index $o$ of the first element greater or equal than $x$.
We then compare such value with the value at index $p = o-1$ (if it exists)
and we promote $o$ or $p$ to be the index closest element to $x$ in the array depending on their
absolute difference to $x$.
The closest of the two to $x$ is chosen to be the designated starting value for the algorithm described above.

For completeness, in Listing \ref{list:find_k_closest_in_array:binary_lower_bound} we also show an implementation of "in-house" version of \inline{std::lower\_bound}. You might be asked 
to show you can code binary search.
