\section{Common Variations - Multiple Transactions}
\label{sec:buy_sell_stocks:multiple_transaction}

\subsection{Problem statement}
\begin{exercise}
This problem is a variation of the problem presented in Section \ref{sec:buy_sell_stocks:statement1} where we are allowed to make as many transactions as we like. The question remains the same: what is the maximum profit achievable?

Note that you may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again.

	\begin{example}
		\hfill \\
		Given the array of prices for the stock is: $[7,1,5,3,6,4]$, the answer is $7$. 
		You can buy on the \nth{2} day and sell on the \nth{3} and then engage on a second transaction where you buy on the \nth{4} day and sell on the \nth{5}.
	\end{example}

\end{exercise}
