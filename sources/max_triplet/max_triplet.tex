\chapter{Max triplet sum}
\label{ch:max_triplet}
\section*{Introduction}

\section{Problem statement}
\begin{exercise}
\label{example:max_triplet:exercice1}
Write a function that, given an array $I$ of length $n$, returns 
the maximum value obtainable by summing $3$ distinct elements of $I$: $I_i$, $I_j$ and $I_k$ such that
$ 0 \leq i < j < k \leq n-1$ and $ A_i < A_j < A_k $.


	%example1
	\begin{example}
		\label{example:max_triplet:example1}
		\hfill \\
		Given $I = \{2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 9\}$ the function returns $16$.
		The max value of $16$ is obtainable by summing together the 
		elements of $I$ at indices: $0$,$1$ and $5$ : $I_0 + I_1+I_5=2+5+9= 16$.
		
		Notice that there is another way of obtains the max sum of $16$, that is by using the elements
		at indices $2$,$4$ and $5$: $I_2 + I_4+I_5=3+4+9= 16$.
	\end{example}

	%example2
	\begin{example}
		\label{example:max_triplet:example2}
		\hfill \\
		Given $I = \{3,2,1\}$ the function returns $-1$ as there is no valid triplet in $I$.		
	\end{example}
	
		\begin{example}
			\hfill \\
			Given $I = \{1,3,2\}$ the function returns $-1$ as there is no valid triplet in $I$.
			\label{ex:max_triplet:example2}	
		\end{example}

	\begin{example}
		\hfill \\
		Given $I = \{1,2,3\}$ the function returns $6$. There is only one valid triplet in $I$.
	\label{ex:max_triplet:example3}
	\end{example}
\end{exercise}

\section{Clarification Questions}

\begin{QandA}
	\item  Is it guaranteed that $I$ contains at least three elements?
	\begin{answered}
		\textit{No. When $n < 3$ the function should return $-1$.}
	\end{answered}
	\item  Is it guaranteed the answer to fit a standard \inline{int}?
	\begin{answered}
		\textit{Yes you can assume the the answer always fits a standard $4$-bytes \inline{int}}
	\end{answered}
\end{QandA}

\section{Discussion}
\label{max_triplet:sec:discussion}
The problem is asking us to find the largest possible sum obtainable by summing up
three distinct elements of $I$ with the additional constraint that when ordered according to their indices 
they form a sorted sequence. 
You can form such a triplet by selecting an element at index $i$,
then another element at index $j$ that it appears after and it is larger than the element at position $i$  
and finally, a third element at index $k$ which appears after and it is larger than the element at index $j$.

\section{Brute-force}
\label{max_triplet:sec:bruteforce}
We can solve this problem trivially in a brute-force manner by trying all possible triplets of ordered indices $i < j <k$
and keep track of the triplet yielding the maximum value.
Three simple nested loops are enough to implement this idea, as shown in Listing \ref{list:max_triplet_bruteforce}.
The time complexity of this approach is $(O(|I|^3)$ which is far from being optimal.
The space complexity is $O(1)$ as no additional space is used.

\section{Precalculation and Binary Search}
The cubic time complexity approach discussed in Section \ref{max_triplet:sec:bruteforce}
can be dramatically improved if we approach the problem a little differently. 
Imagine we would be able to efficiently $L_j$ and $G_j$ for an element at index $j$ where :
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $L_j$ is the largest value of any of the elements of $I$ appearing at any index smaller than $j$ and it is smaller than $I_j$ and,
	\item $G_j$ is the largest value among any of the elements of $I$ appearing at any index higher than $j$ and it is larger than $I_J$.
\end{enumerate}
When these value are available we can calculate the value of the largest sum obtainable by any triplet having the $I_j$  as the middle element.
The triplet $(L_j, I_j, G_j)$ yield the largest sum as if that was not the case it means that either exists a larger element than $L_j$ that is smaller than $I_j$ in any of the positions before $j$
or that exists an element that is larger than $G_j$  in any of the positions after $j$. Both of these two scenarios are impossible  because $L_j$ is by definition the largest element 
that is smaller than $I_j$ and appears before index $j$  and similarly,  $G_j$ is defined to be the largest element appearing after index $j$ and that is larger than $I_j$.

We can use this fact to calculate the answer to this problem by looping over $I$ and for each element $I_j$ calculate $L_j+ I_j+ G_j$. The largest of the sums calculated this way is the final answer.
But how can we calculate $L_j$ and $G_j$ for $I_j$?

$L_j$ can be calculated efficiently by keeping a sorted list of all the values appearing before index $j$ and use binary search to find $L_j$ in the list while $G_j$ can be precalculated
in a similar fashion to what we have done for the problem in Chapter \ref{ch:greatest_right}.
