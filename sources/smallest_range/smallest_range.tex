\chapter{Smallest Range \RN{1} and \RN{2}}
\label{ch:smallest_range}
\section*{Introduction}
This chapter discusses a problem on an array and one of its variations. Both are very common
interview questions, with the former having a really easy solution, and the latter being slightly
more complex. Both however, can be solved by starting from the same idea and in just a handful of
lines of code.

\section{Problem statement}
\begin{exercise}
\label{example:smallest_range:exercice1}
Write a function that given given an array of integers $I$ and an integer $K /geq 0$ returns the smallest
possible difference between the smallest and largest value in $I$ after you have added to each of
the elements $-K \leq p \leq K$.

	%example1
	\begin{example}
		\label{example:smallest_range:example1}
		\hfill \\
		Given $I = \{3,5,1,7,8\}$ and $K=4$ the function returns $0$. You can modify add to $I$ the
		followings values $\{1,-1,3,-3,-4\}$. The modified array finally becomes:
		$I'=\{4,4,4,4,4\}$. 
		
	\end{example}

	%example2
	\begin{example}
		\label{example:smallest_range:example2}
		\hfill \\
		Given $I = \{1,9,4\}$ and $K=2$ the function returns $4$.
	\end{example}

\end{exercise}

\section{Clarification Questions}

\begin{QandA}
	\item Can you add $p$ multiple times to an element of $I$?
	\begin{answered}
		\textit{No, you can only add $p$ once to each element of $I$.}
	\end{answered}	
\end{QandA}

\section{Discussion}
\label{smallest_range:sec:discussion}
For this problem we are going to skip even discussing a brute-force solution because it is
impractical to actually code it during an interview. Moreover, such a solution is conceptually very
different and time complexity-wise far off from the one that allows us to solve this problem efficiently.
So let's jump directly into the core of a good solution.

The problem is asking us to minimize the difference between the largest value $M$, and the smallest
value $m$ of $I$ after we have processed it by adding to each and every of its element a
value in the range $[-K,+K]$. 
Let's call $B$ this post-processed version of $I$. 
We know that if $K$ is large enough\footnote{When I say "large enough" I really mean that 
$(M-K) - (m+K) = M-m-2K \leq 0$.} so that we can bring $M$ and $m$ to the same value,
by subtracting from $M$ and adding to $m$, then we make all the elements of $B$ equal,
thus reducing the difference between $I$'s smallest and
the largest element to zero (see Figure \ref{fig:smallest_range:explanation2}).
This is possible because $M-m$ is the  largest difference in $I$ and if we can effectively close their gap to $0$
then we can do the same with any other difference between any other pair of elements of $I$.
On the other hand, if $K$ is not large enough, then all we know
is that we can reduce the difference between $m$ and $M$ to $d=(M-K)-(m+K)$.
Notice that in this case $d > 0$  (see Figure \ref{fig:smallest_range:explanation1}).
Moreover, similarly to what we have discussed above, because the difference between any other pair of elements of $I$ is smaller than $M-m$, we also know that their
differences can be made at least  equal or smaller  than $d$.


\begin{figure}
	\vspace*{-0.5in}
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.90\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sources/smallest_range/images/explanation1} 
		\caption{$m$ and $M$ are the smallest and largest element of $I$, respectively. You can
		bring them closer together by adding $K$ to $m$ and subtracting $-K$ to $M$. $d$ is the
		difference between these two new values. $d$ will always be larger than any other difference
		you can obtain the same way. You can see that any other pair $(I[i], I[j])$ will have
		smaller difference because they are closer together to begin with.}
		\label{fig:smallest_range:explanation1} 
	 \end{subfigure}
	\hfill
	\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.90\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sources/smallest_range/images/explanation2} 
		\caption{$m$ and $M$ are the smallest and largest element of $I$, respectively. If we  add
		$K$ to $m$ and subtract $-K$ to $M$ then in this case $m+K$ will be larger than $M-K$. This
		means that we can add to $m$ and subtract to $M$ a number $p \leq K$ such that $m+p = M-p$.
		Because any other number in $I$ is larger than $m$ and smaller than $M$ we can do the same
		with them, so that we bring all the elements to the same value.}
		\label{fig:smallest_range:explanation2} 
	 \end{subfigure}
	 \hfill
	 \label{}
	 \caption{}
\end{figure}
Therefore in order to solve this problem we only have to look at $M$ and $m$ and calculate
$d=(M-K)-(m+K)$. If $d \leq 0$ then it means that we can make all the elements of $I$ equal and the
function should return $0$, otherwise we can safely return $d$ as an answer.

You can find an implementation of this idea in Listing \ref{list:smallest_range:solution1} which has
$O(|I|)$ time and $O(1)$ space complexity.
The \inline{std::minmax_element}\footnote{\url{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/minmax_element}} function  returns a pair of iterator pointing to the minimum and maximum element of the input range, respectively.

\section{Common Variations}
\subsection{Smallest range \RN{2} } This variant is almost identical to the main problem of this
chapter (Exercise \ref{}) except that this time we are only allowed to add either $-K$ or $+K$ to
each and every element of the input array $I$. As we shall see, this complicates things quite a bit,
but, nevertheless, the core solution strategy  remains the same. 

\begin{exercise}
	\label{example:smallest_range:variation1:exercice1}
	Write a function that given given an array of integers $I$ and an integer $K$ returns the
	smallest possible difference between the smallest and largest value in $I$ after you have added
	to each of the elements either $-K$ or $K$.
	
		%example1
		\begin{example}
			\label{example:smallest_range:variation1:example1}
			\hfill \\
			Given $I = \{3,5,1,7,8\}$ and $K=4$ the function returns $xxx$. You can modify add to
			$I$ the followings values $\{xxxxx\}$. The modified array finally becomes:
			$I'=\{xxxxx\}$. 
			
		\end{example}
	
		%example2
		\begin{example}
			\label{example:smallest_range:variation1:example2}
			\hfill \\
			Given $I = \{1,9,4\}$ and $K=2$ the function returns $xxxxx$.
		\end{example}
	
	\end{exercise}
