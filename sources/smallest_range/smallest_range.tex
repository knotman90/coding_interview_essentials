\chapter{Smallest Range \RN{1} and \RN{2}}
\label{ch:smallest_range}
\section*{Introduction}
This chapter discusses a problem and one of its variations on arrays. Both are very common interview
questions, with the former having a simple solution, and the latter being slightly more
complex. Both variants however, can be solved by starting from the same idea and using just a handful
of lines of code.

\section{Problem statement}
\begin{exercise}
\label{example:smallest_range:exercice1}
Write a function that  - given an array of integers $I$ and an integer $K \geq 0$  - returns the
smallest possible difference between the smallest and largest value in $I$ after you have added  $-K \leq p \leq K$ to
each of the elements.

	%example1
	\begin{example}
		\label{example:smallest_range:example1}
		\hfill \\
		Given $I = \{3,5,1,7,8\}$ and $K=4$ the function returns $0$. You can add $I$ to the
		following values: $\{1,-1,3,-3,-4\}$. The modified array becomes: $B=\{4,4,4,4,4\}$. 
	\end{example}

	%example2
	\begin{example}
		\label{example:smallest_range:example2}
		\hfill \\
		Given $I = \{1,9,4\}$ and $K=2$ the function returns $4$.
	\end{example} 
\end{exercise}

\section{Clarification Questions}

\begin{QandA}
	\begin{questionitem} \begin{question} Can you add $p$ multiple times to an element of $I$?  \end{question} 	 
    \begin{answered}
		\textit{No, you can only add $p$ once to each element of $I$.}
	\end{answered} \end{questionitem}	
\end{QandA}

\section{Discussion}
\label{smallest_range:sec:discussionMain}
For this problem it isn't valuable to discuss the brute-force solution\footnote{Constructing
	and returning the difference between the largest and smallest element among all of the
	$2K^{|I|}$ possible arrays you can obtain by adding any of the $2K$ between $-K$ and $K$ to each
	and every element of $I$.} as it is impractical to actually code it during an interview.
	Moreover, such a solution is conceptually very different and,  time complexity-wise, very far from the one that allows us to solve problem most efficiently. Instead, we will go directly to examining a better approach to the solution. 
	

The problem is asking us to minimize the difference between the largest value ($M$) and the smallest
value ($m$) of $I$ after we have processed it by adding to each and every of its element a value in
the range $[-K,+K]$. Let's call $B$ this post-processed version of $I$. We know that if $K$ is large
enough\footnote{ \quotes{large enough} in this context means that $(M-K) - (m+K) = M-m-2K \leq 0$.} so
that we can modify $M$ and $m$ to be the same value by subtracting from $M$ and adding to $m$ then
we make all the elements of $I$ equal, thus reducing the difference between $I$'s smallest and the
largest element to zero (see Figure \ref{fig:smallest_range:explanation2}). This is possible because
$M-m$ is the  largest difference in $I$ and if we can effectively close their gap to $0$ then we can
do the same with any other difference between any pair of elements of $I$. On the other hand, if $K$
is not large enough\footnote{When $(M-m) > 2K$.} , then all we know is that we can reduce the
difference between $m$ and $M$ to $d=(M-K)-(m+K)$. Note that in this case $d > 0$  (see Figure
\ref{fig:smallest_range:explanation1}). Moreover, similar to what we have discussed above, because
the difference between any other pair of elements of $I$ is smaller than or equal to ($M-m$), we also
know that their differences can be made at least equal to or smaller than $d$.


\begin{figure}
	\vspace*{-0.5in}
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.90\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sources/smallest_range/images/explanation1} 
		\caption{$m$ and $M$ are the smallest and largest element of $I$, respectively. You can
		bring them closer together by adding $K$ to $m$ and subtracting $K$ to $M$. $d$ is the
		difference between these two new values. $d$ will always be larger than any other difference
		you can obtain in the same way. You can see that any other pair $(I[i], I[j])$ will have a
		smaller difference because they are closer together to begin with.}
		\label{fig:smallest_range:explanation1} 
	 \end{subfigure}
	\medskip
	\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.90\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sources/smallest_range/images/explanation2} 
		\caption{$m$ and $M$ are the smallest and largest element of $I$, respectively. If we  add
		$K$ to $m$ and subtract $K$ to $M$ then in this case $(m+K)$ will be larger than $(M-K)$.
		This means that we can add to $m$ and subtract to $M$ a number $p \leq K$ such that $m+p =
		M-p$. Because any other number in $I$ is larger than $m$ and smaller than $M$ we can do the
		same with them, so that we bring all the elements to the same value.}
		\label{fig:smallest_range:explanation2} 
	 \end{subfigure}
	 \medskip
	 \label{}
	 \caption{}
\end{figure}
Therefore in order to solve this problem we only have to look at $M$ and $m$ and calculate
$d=(M-K)-(m+K)$. If $d \leq 0$ then it means that we can make all the elements of $I$ equal and the
function should return $0$, otherwise we can safely return $d$ as an answer.

You can find an implementation of this idea in Listing \ref{list:smallest_range:solution1} which has
$O(|I|)$ time and $O(1)$ space complexity. The
\inline{std::minmax_element}\footnote{\url{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/minmax_element}}
function  returns a pair of iterators pointing to the minimum and maximum element of the input
range, respectively.

\section{Common Variations}

\subsection{Smallest range \RN{2} } This variant is almost identical to the main problem in this
chapter (see Exercise \ref{example:smallest_range:exercice1}) except that this time we are only
allowed to add either $-K$ or $+K$ (and not any number in the range $[-K,K$) to each
element of the input array $I$. As we shall see, this complicates things somewhat but,
nevertheless, the core solution strategy remains the same. 

\begin{exercise}
	\label{example:smallest_range:variation1:exercice1}
	Write a function that  - given an array of integers $I$ and an integer $K$ -  returns the
	smallest possible difference between the smallest and largest value in $I$ after you have added either $-K$ or $K$
	to each of the elements .

			\label{example:smallest_range:variation1:example1}
			\hfill \\
			Given $I = \{3,5,1,7,8\}$ and $K=2$ the function returns $3$. You can modify add to
			$I$ the followings values $\{2,-2,2,-2,-2\}$. The modified array finally becomes:
			$I'=\{5,3,3,5,6\}$. 
		\end{example}
	
		%example2
		\begin{example}
			\label{example:smallest_range:variation1:example2}
			\hfill \\
			Given $I = \{1,9,4\}$ and $K=3$ the function returns $3$.

\section{Discussion}
\label{smallest_range:sec:discussion}
Let's start by noting that the solution to this problem is always smaller than or equal to the
difference between the largest ($M)$ and smaller  $(m)$ elements of $I$. This is the case because in
the worst case scenario we can either add or subtract $K$ to all of the elements of $I$ and therefore
preserve the relative difference between all the elements of $I$ (including $M$ and $m$). We have
this case when $(M-m) \leq K$ because subtracting and adding $K$ to $M$ and $m$, respectively, would
eventually lead to a larger or equal difference\footnote{The idea behind this is that adding
$K$ to $m$ would yield $m' = m+K$ which is greater than or equal to $M$. Similarly, subtracting $K$ from
$M$ would yield $M' = M-K$ which is smaller than or equal to $m$. The gap between $m'$ and $M'$ is
larger than or equal to the gap between $m$ and $M$. When $(M-m) < K$ then we can express $K$ in terms
of $M-m$ as follows: $K = M-m + x$ where $x \geq 0$. Therefore by adding $K$ to $m$ and subtracting
$K$ from $M$ we get: $|(M-K) - (m-K)| = |(M-(M-m + x)) - (m + (M-m + x))| = |(m-x) - (M+x)|$ which is
at least as large as $M-m$.

For instance given $I = \{1,2,6,8\}$ and $K = 10 > (8-1) = 7$ if we add $10$ to the smallest element
of $I$ and substract $10$ from its largest element, we end up with: $1+10 = 11$ and $8-10=-2$. The difference
between these two new values is $11-(-2) = 13$ which is definitely larger than the difference
between $1$ and $8$.}.

When $(M-m) > K$ then what we can do is to choose one element at index $j$ as a pivot point
and add $K$ to all the elements smaller than or equal to $I_j$ and subtract $K$ from all of the elements
of $I$ greater than $I_j$. The new gap depends on the new smallest ($m'$) and largest elements
($M'$). Given $p$ is the smallest element larger than $I_j$ then $M'$ is the largest among $I_j+K$
and $M-K$ while $m'$ is the smallest among $p - K$ and $m+K$. Therefore for a given $j$ we calculate
the maximum gap as $d_j = M'-m'$. The final answer is the smallest of these gaps calculated for each
of index of $I$.

This approach relies on being able to quickly identify elements that are smaller or greater than a
given value. If the array is sorted this can be achieved quite efficiently. In-fact if $I$ is sorted
then  - for a given $j$  - all the elements that are smaller than $I_j$ appear at indices smaller than $j$
and, similarly, all the elements that are larger appear at indices larger than $j$. Therefore, if
$I$ is sorted then $m'$ is the smallest among $I_{j+1}-K$ and $I_0 +K$ and $M'$ is the largest among
$I_j+K$ and $I_{|I|-1}-K$.


We can use these observation to derive the following algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item sort the input array $I$,
	\item for each $j = 0 \ldots |I|-1$ calculate $d_j = \max{(I_j+K,I_{|I|-1}-K)} -
	\min{(I_{j+1}-K, I_0 +K)}$,
	\item return the smallest $d_j$.
\end{enumerate}
An execution of this algorithm for the Example \ref{example:smallest_range:variation1:example1} is
shown in the Figure \ref{fig:smallest_range:bars_execution}. The initial input is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:smallest_range:bars_full} where the smallest and greatest value are $m=1$ and $M=8$,
respectively. The only way for their gap to become smaller is for $M$ to be decreased and $m$ to be
increased by $K$. Figure \ref{fig:smallest_range:bars2} shows how $I$ would look if we 
add $K$ to all the elements smaller than or equal to $j=0$ and subtract $K$ from the others. The
highlighted boxes show the new array values while the white boxes show the original values. Note
that the gap between the new minimum ($1$, obtained by subtracting $2$ from the original element
with value $3$) and the new maximum element ($6$, obtained by subtracting $2$ from $8$) is now
$6-3=3$. Similarly Figure \ref{fig:smallest_range:bars3} shows the resulting array for $j=3$. The
new array minimum and maximum values are now $3$ and $6$, respectively. When $j=2$ or $j=3$, as we
can see in Figures \ref{fig:smallest_range:bars4} and \ref{fig:smallest_range:bars15} the gap
increases where $j=1$. Finally Figure \ref{fig:smallest_range:bars6} shows the
case where all the new elements are obtained by adding $K$. This scenario leaves the relative
distance between the elements unchanged with regard to the original values and therefore, not surprisingly,
the gap between the smallest and largest element is $7$ (as in Figure
\ref{fig:smallest_range:bars_full}).


Listing \ref{list:smallest_range:solution2} shows an implementation of this idea. Note that in
the code $m'$ is \inline{m_new} and $M'$ is \inline{M_new}.
