\chapter{Number of Dice Rolls With Target Sum}
\label{ch:dice_rolls}
\section*{Introduction}
Dices have been around for quite a long time, with the oldest dice known actually discovered in Iran 
as part of Backgamonn\footnote{One of the oldest board game. A two-players game where pieces are moved around between twenty-four triangles according to the roll of two $6$ faces dices. The goal of each player is to remove all of their $15$ pieces before the other player.}
set more than a staggering five-thousands years old! 

We are used to the common $6$ faces dice (see Figure \ref{fig:cycle_in_list:6faces_dice}) 
but in reality dices come in all shapes and forms like the $20$ faces icosahedron (see Figure \ref{fig:dice_rolls:20faces_dice}) shape dice or the $12$ faces dodecahedron dice (see Figure \ref{fig:dice_rolls:12faces_dice}).
For this problem we will use up to $30$ dices at the same time each with up to $30$ faces and we are going to calculate the number of ways 
we can obtain a certain target value when thrown all at the same time.


\section{Problem statement}
\begin{exercise}
You have $d$ dice, and each die has $f$ faces numbered $1, 2, \ldots..., f$.

Write a function that returns the number of possible ways to roll the dices so the sum of the upper faces
equals a given number target number $t$.
Because this number can be very large, the answer should be returned modulo $10^9 + 7$.

	\begin{example}
		\hfill \\
		Given $d=1$, $f=6$ and $t=6$ the function should return $1$.
	\end{example}

	\begin{example}
		\hfill \\
		Given $d=2$, $f=6$ and $t=7$ the function should return $6$. 
		The followings are the possible ways of obtaining $7$ from two common $6$ faces dices.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $1$ for the fist and $6$ for the second dice.
			\item $2$ for the fist and $5$ for the second dice.
			\item $3$ for the fist and $4$ for the second dice.
			\item $4$  for the fist and $3$ for the second dice.
			\item $5$  for the fist and $2$ for the second dice.
			\item $6$  for the fist and $1$ for the second dice.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{example}

	\begin{example}
		\hfill \\
		Given $d=2$, $f=3$ and $t=7$ the function should return $0$ because the highest number obtainable by rolling two dices with three faces is $6$.
	\end{example}
\end{exercise}

\section{Clarification Questions}

\section{Discussion}
\label{dice_rolls:sec:discussion}
Let's start by noticing that the answer can be astronomically high but most importantly the number of possible combinations of dices rolls is even larger: $f^d$. 
Therefore, a  brute-force approach, where we go over each and every possible roll of the $d$ dices is completely out of the picture given the constraints on the maximum number of 
of dices and faces we might get for input.

This type of \textit{"counting"} problems are usually solved by using a dynamic programming approach. In-fact and 
no surprisingly this problem share a lot of similarities with the \textit{Coin change} problem we discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:coin_change}
to the point that you could solve this problem using the solution to the other. If you are unfamiliar the solutions to that problem you might want to refresh your memory
before reading-on. 
We can consider the problem treated in this chapter to be a proper specialization of the \textit{Coin change} (Chapter \ref{ch:coin_change}) 
problem where the number of available coins is equal to $d$ and the denomination of the coins are $1,2,\ldots,f$.

\subsection{Brute-force}
\label{dice_rolls:sec:bruteforce}
The brute-force solution consist in finding all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting the ones yielding sum $t$. 
When dealing with this kind of enumeration tasks where you have to generate a combinations recursion is usually the way to go. 
We start with the first dice and for this dice we have $f$ possible values we can assign to it, 
but once the value for this specific dice is set, let's say for the sake of this example $3$,
then we are left with $d-1$ dices and we still have to make up for $t-3$  with those $d-1$ dices.

Once a dice is rolled we are left with exactly the original problem on a smaller number of dices and target.
This is why recursion is handy. The problem is easily defined in terms of subproblems.
This recursive process ends in two cases:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $d<0$ or $t<0$ the answer is $0$. There is no solution to the problem when the number of dices to use is negative or the target number is negative.
	\item $t=0$. We have reached or target value. If we have used \textbf{all} dices then we have a solution otherwise not. So:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item if $d=0$, we have used all $d$ dices and the sum is exactly equal to $t$. This is a valid combination
		\item if $d>0$ then we have not set the value for all the dices and we have no more room for an additional value from another dice. This is not a good combination.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


Listing \ref{list:dice_rolls:bruteforce} shows a possible implementation of such idea. Please note that this code is remarkably similar to the brute-force solution  for the Coin Change problem in Chapter \ref{ch:coin_change}.

\subsection{Dynamic Programming - Recursive top-down}
\label{dice_rolls:sec:DP}
As per many other problems solvable with DP, the brute-force solution presented in Listing \ref{list:dice_rolls:bruteforce} can be turned into a much more efficient one by simply realizing that the same problem is solved over and over again. When this happens we can simply store the result of intermediate problems into a cache and use the values in the cache before trying to compute the answer (see Chapter \ref{valid_parenthesis:sec:dp}). 
For instance consider what happens during the execution of the code in Listing \ref{list:dice_rolls:bruteforce} for the following input:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $d = 3$
	\item $f = 6$
	\item $t = 12$
\end{itemize}

The function subproblem \inline{num_rolls_to_target_bruteforce(1,5,6)} solved $6$ times and the subproblem \inline{num_rolls_to_target_bruteforce(1,4,6)} is solved $5$ times. If you are not convinced draw the recursion tree, or add a print statement at the beginning of the function. All these superfluous execution can be avoided if the result of each of the subproblem is stored into a cache as shown in Listing \ref{list:dice_rolls:dp}. This implementation is an almost identical copy of the brute-force solution with the addition of a cache. Note how \textbf{before} actually trying to compute the answer we first look into the cache to see if we already did. If not, we solve the problem and before returning the answer we \textbf{save} the result into the cache.
