\section*{Introduction}

\section{Problem statement}
\begin{exercise}
\label{example:next_greater_element:exercice1}
Write a function that given two arrays with no duplicates $A$ and $B$ where $A \subset B$ returns an
array $C$ of size $|A|$ where $C_i$ contains the next greater element of $A_i$ among the elements of
$B$. The next greater element of a number $A_i$ is defined as the smallest element greater than
$A_i$ among the elements of $B$ from index $j$ to $|B|-1$ where $B_j = A_i$

In other words, for each $A_i$ the function finds the smallest element in $B$ that is greater than
$A_i$ among the cells that are to the right of the cell in $B$ having the value $A_i$ and places it
into $C$ at index $i$.

	%example1
	\begin{example}
		\label{example:next_greater_element:example1}
		\hfill \\
		Given $A=\{4,1,2\}$ and $B=\{1,3,4,2\}$ the function returns $C=\{-1,2,-1\}$. $C_0 = -1$
		because there $A_0 = 4$ appears in $B$ at index $2$ and there is no cells to the right of
		$B_2$ that is strictly greater than $4$. $C_1 = 2$ because $1$ appears in $B$ at index $0$
		and the smallest element larger than $1$ after index $0$ in $B$ is the element $2$ in the
		last position. $C_2 = -1$ because $A_2 = 2$ appears in $B$ at index $3$ and there is no
		element ot the right of it. Note that there exists a value in $B$ that is larger than $2$
		but we are not considering it because it appears to the left of the cell in $B$ holding
		value $A_2=2$.
		
	\end{example}

	%example2
	\begin{example}
		\label{example:next_greater_element:example2}
		\hfill \\
		Given $A=\{2,4\}$ and $B=\{9,2,1,4,12,8\}$ the function returns $C=\{4,8\}$. $C_0 = 4$
		because there $A_0 = 2$ appears in $B$ at index $1$ and  the smallest element larger than
		$2$ in $B$ from the cell to the right of the one at index $1$ is $4$.
		
		$C_1 = 8$ because there $A_0 = 4$ appears in $B$ at index $3$ and  the smallest element
		larger than $2$ in $B$ from the cell to the right of the one at index $3$ is $8$, appearing
		at the very end of $B$. Notice that $12$ is also larger than $4$ and appearing to the right
		of the index $3$ but is not the right answer because it is not the smallest.
	\end{example}
\end{exercise}

\section{Clarification Questions}

\begin{QandA}
	\item How should the function behave when an element of $A$ does not have a next greater in $B$?
	\begin{answered}
		\textit{The function can insert $-1$ in the corresponding cell of $C$.}
	\end{answered}
	
\end{QandA}

\subsection{Brute-force}
\label{next_greater_element:sec:bruteforce}
This problem has a very intuitive brute-force solution that boils down into the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item looping through each element at index $i$ of $A$
	\item finding the position $j$ in $B$ where the value $A_i$ appear i.e. $B_j = A_i$ (which
	exists because $A \subset B$)
	\item find the smallest element larger than $A_i$ in $B$ only considering the positions strictly
	after $j$.
\end{enumerate}
An implementation of this approach is shown in Listing \ref{list:next_greater_element:bruteforce}
where we use \inline{std::find} to the location in $B$ (the iterator \inline{it}) where $A_j$
exists. The subsequent \inline{while} is used to scan the remaining of the array and to keep track
of the smallest element that is larger than $A_i$. The complexity of this approach is $O(|A| \times
|B|)$ as we could potentially do linear  work (proportional to $|B|$) for each and every element of
$A$. One of such case is when the elements of $A$ appears in the first positions of $B$.

\section{$O(|B|log(|B|))$ time, $O(|B|)$ space solution}
\label{next_greater_element:sec:nlogntime}
We can solve this problem much faster than quadratic time if we are willing to use some additional
space (as it is often the case). In particular the problem would be easily solvable if we would have
a map containing the information about the next greater element for each of the elements of $B$. We
could simply loop over all the elements of $A$ and query such a map to get the required answer.
However we have just shifted the problem which now is, how can we generate such a map?

The idea is that we can fill the map for each element of $B$ starting from the back and at the same
time keep a sorted list of all the elements of $B$ that we have already processed. This list can be
used to quickly (by doing a binary search on it) find the upper bound for a given value. The upper
bound for an integer $x$ is the first (or smallest) element in a collection that is strictly larger
than $x$. The upper bound operation can be easily implemented on a sorted collection using binary
search. We have already implemented a similar operation (the lower bound) in Chapter
\ref{ch:find_k_closest_in_array} and you can check Listing
\ref{list:find_k_closest_in_array:binary_lower_bound} (at page
\pageref{list:find_k_closest_in_array:binary_lower_bound}) to have an idea of how you can go about
brewing  your own version of \inline{upper_bound}.


The idea described above is implemented in Listing \ref{list:next_greater_element:set}. The
\inline{std::set<int> N} contains the sorted list of elements of $B$ that we have already processed
while the \inline{std::unordered_map<int,int> C_val} contains the information about the upper bounds
for each of the processed elements of $B$. The first \inline{for} goes through each element $j$ of
$B$ (from the back to the front) and calculates the answer for $B_j$ by looking into the sorted
\inline{std::set} $N$\footnote{Note that we do not use the free function
\href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/upper_bound}{\inline{std::upper_bound}} because on
non linear data structures (like \inline{std::set}) it operates in linear time instead of
logarithmic time.}. The second \inline{for} loop only takes care of copying the relevant information
from the map \inline{C_val} to the return array. The time and space complexity of this code are
$O(|B|log(|B|))$ (each of the $|B|$ insertions in $N$ costs $O(log(|B|)$) and $O(|B|)$,
respectively.

\section{Common Variation}
\subsection{First next greater element}
\label{next_greater_element:sec:first}
There is a common variation of this problem featuring an almost identical statement to the one shown
in Section \ref{} with the only difference being that for an element of $A_i$ we should return the
first (and not the necessarily the smallest like in the original variant) element in $B$ that is
greater than $A_i$.

\begin{exercise}
	\label{example:next_greater_element:exercice2}
	Write a function that given two arrays with no duplicates $A$ and $B$ where $A \subset B$
	returns an array $C$ of size $|A|$ where $C_i$ contains the first element greater than $A_i$
	among the elements of $B$ strictly after the cell at index $j$, where $B_j = A_i$.
	
	In other words, for each $A_i$ the function finds the first element in $B$ that is greater than
	$A_i$ among the cells that are to the right of the cell in $B$ having the value $A_i$ and places
	it into $C$ at index $i$.

\end{exercise}

\section{Discussion}
\label{next_greater_element:sec:variation1:discussion}
The difference with the original variation is minimal but is big enough so that we have a
linear-time solution for this problem. While to solve the original problem  we were forced to keep a
sorted list of all the already processed elements of $B$, this time we can simply keep a stack
storing only those processed elements of $B$ so that they form an increasing sequence.

Suppose we have a decreasing sequence followed by a greater number: For example, consider the
following list: $\{7,8,5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 6\}$ (see Figure \ref{fig:next_greater:stack});
initially the stack is empty and when we process the
first number ($6$), there clearly no greater element at its right. Because the stack is empty,
adding $6$ to it would still preserve the fact that the numbers contained in it form an increasing
sequence (see Figure \ref{fig:next_greater:variation1:stack1}).
When the $1$ is processed, then the stack is not empty and $6$ is at the top which is larger
than $1$. Therefore we can use $6$ as an answer for $1$ and add $1$ to the stack because the
sequence $1,6$ is still increasing (see Figure \ref{fig:next_greater:variation1:stack2}). Things however, are a bit different when $2$ is processed. This
time at the top of the stack we find a $1$ which is smaller  than $2$. Therefore the top of the
stack cannot be the answer for the element $2$. Moreover the sequence $2,1,6$ would not be
increasing and therefore the two cannot be placed on top of the stack as-is. What we do is removing
the elements from the current stack until adding the placing the $2$ at the top
would make the elements in the stack an
increasing sequence. 
So we remove $1$ from the stack and the new stack becomes 
$2,6$ (see Figure \ref{fig:next_greater:variation1:stack3}). 

The rest of the execution is described more in detail in (see Figure \ref{fig:next_greater:stack}


From this example we can draw a general approach about how we can solve this problem using a stack. 
When we process an element we try to insert it into the stack paying attention to how this element compares to the top of the stack.
If it is larger than we remove the top of the stack and compare it again with the subsequent element. 
We keep repeating and removing elements from the stack until either the element we are tryi8ng to place is smaller than the current element of there are no more elements left in the stack.
In the former case then the new top of the stack is going to be the answer associated with the element we are processing. In the latter the answer does not exists and this element is therefore, the largest element processed so far.
Listing \ref{list:next_greater_element:stack} shows an implementation of this idea.
