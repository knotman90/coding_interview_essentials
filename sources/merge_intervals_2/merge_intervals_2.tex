\chapter{Merge Intervals}
\label{ch:merge_intervals_2}
\section*{Introduction}
Intervals are common in programming and they pop up in numerous applications as they are very versatile and are used to represent many things, from segments in geometry applications to time spans for timetable building (e.g. for keeping track of the availibility of meeting rooms for instance) or resourse scheduling.

Intervals are also quite popular in interview questions; In this chapter will go through one that is commonly asked (still nowadays) at Google where we are given a list of time intervals and we need to produce a new list where none of the elements overlap with one another.

In Section \ref{example:merge_intervals_2:exercice1_2}, a variation of this problem where we are given a list of time intervals where we are guaranteed none of them overlaps wtih one another to begin with and our job is to insert a new interval in the list in such a way that the non-overlapping property is maintained.



\section{Problem statement}
\begin{exercise}
\label{example:merge_intervals_2:exercice1_1}
Write a function that, given a list of intervals $I=\{(s_0, e_0),(s_1, e_1), \ldots,(s_{n-1}, e_{n-1})\}$ represented as a pair of integers, returns a new list $I'$ which is a copy of $I$ except that overlapping intervals are merged together. 
The resulting list should only contain non-overlapping intervals.

	%example1
	\begin{example}
		\label{example:merge_intervals_2:example1_1}
		\hfill \\
		Given $I=\{(3, 7),(1, 5), (6, 8),(4, 6)  \}$ returns $I'=\{(1,8)\}$.
	\end{example}

	\begin{example}
		\label{example:merge_intervals_2:example1_2}
		\hfill \\
		Given $I=\{(1, 5), (6, 7), (4, 4), (9, 12) \}$ returns $I'=\{(1,5),(6,7),(9,12)\}$.
	\end{example}
\end{exercise}

\section{Clarification Questions}

\begin{QandA}
	\begin{questionitem} \begin{question} (If not clear from the examples) Is it guaranteed for the intervals to be sorted? (either by the starting or ending time of the interval) \end{question} 	 
    \begin{answered}
		\textit{No, the input is not sorted.}
	\end{answered} \end{questionitem}

	\begin{questionitem} \begin{question} Can the input list be modified?\end{question} 	 
    \begin{answered}
		\textit{No, $I$ is read-only.}
	\end{answered} \end{questionitem}

	\begin{questionitem} \begin{question} Can we always assume that given an interval $(x,y)$ in $I$, $ x \leq y$ always holds?\end{question} 	 
		\begin{answered}
			\textit{Yes individual intervals have the first component always smaller or equal than the second.}
		\end{answered} \end{questionitem}
\end{QandA}


\section{Discussion}
\label{example:merge_intervals_2:discussion_1}
Let's have a closer look at why Example \ref{example:merge_intervals_2:example1_1} results in $I'=\{(1,8)\}$.
Intervals $(3,7)$ and $(1,5)$ overlap and they can be merged into $(1,7)$ which can in turn, be merged with both $(6,8)$ and $(4,6)$.
Because $\{(4,6)\}$ lies completely inside $(1,7)$, merging them results still in $(1,7)$.
Finally, $\{(1,7)\}$ also overlaps with $(6,8)$ and blending the two of them together yields $\{(1,8)\}$.

We can determine if two intervals $a=(a_s,a_e)$ and $b=(b_s,b_e)$ overlap if any of the following is true:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $a$ is fully contained in $b$: this happens when both $a_s$ and $a_e$ are within $b$ i.e. $a_s \geq b_s$ and   $a_e \leq b_e$ e.g. $(10,19)$ is fully contained in $(9,20)$;
	\item $b$ is fully contained in $a$;
	\item $a_s$ is partially contained in $b$ i.e. $a_s \geq b_s $ and $a_s \leq b_e$.
	\item $b_s$ is partially contained in $a$ i.e. $b_s \geq a_s $ and $b_s \leq a_e$.
\end{itemize}
If none of the above condition is met then $a$ and $b$ are completely disjoint.

\subsection{Brute-Force}
\label{example:merge_intervals_2:bruteforce_1}
We can use these facts to build a solution that examines one interval at the time, starting from the first one and greedily tries to merge it with as many other intervals as possible.
The idea is that once we picked an interval $x$ we will merge it with all the other overlapping intervals. 
This results in a interval $m$ which is the combination of $x$ and zero or more other intervals in the list.
We can at this point add $m$ to the output list. We can also mark the intervals we merged $x$ with, so that they will be ignored for the remainder of the process: after-all they are already accounted for in $m$.
If we repeat this process for each and every unmarked interval of $I$ we will eventually have an output list $I$ that contains only un-mergable and non-overlapping intervals. 
This idea is implemented in Listing \ref{list:merge_intervals_2_bruteforce}. 

\lstinputlisting[language=c++, caption={Quadratic time solution.},label=list:merge_intervals_2_bruteforce]{sources/merge_intervals_2/merge_intervals_2_merge_entire_list_solution2.cpp}

The function \inline{merge} contains the logic for merging two intervals and it is used in the main function \inline{merge_list_intervals_entire_list_bruteforce} that loops through the elements of the input list one at the time and carefully uses an array of boolean flags \inline{excluded} to mark intervals that have been already merged.
If an interval is not yet merged into the output list \inline{ans} then we place it at the back of \inline{ans} and then we try to merge it with the rest of the unmarked intervals (in the innermost loop).
Whenever it overlaps with some other interval the resulting merged interval is substituted at the back of \inline{ans} and the interval it was merged with is marked as to be excluded from further examination in the future iterations.
Therefore each and every interval is either used as a starting seed and is tested for overlap and potentially merged with the remaining of the not yet excluded intervals or, it is skipped altogether because was already merged in a previous iteration.
Notice that the inner loop starts at $j=i+1$ as intervals before position $i$ have been already merged (and clearly we do not need to test for overlapping when $i=j$).

Using this strategy, we are sure that the output list will never contain any interval that is not covered by one or more intervals in the input list. 
Similarly, if a value is covered by an interval in $I$ then, we are also guaranteed it will be contained in the output.
In other words, if you imagine that a list of intervals represent colored segments of a line then $I$ and $I'$ would produce the very same exact coloring of the line.

The complexity of this function is quadratic in time; when we have an input list containing only non-overlapping intervals, none of them (except the one we are trying to merge the others with) will ever be excluded and that means a full run of the innerloop will occur.

The space complexity is linear as we use an array of the same size of $I$ for the output list as well as for the array of flags \inline{excluded}. 

\subsection{$nlog(n)$ sorting solution}
\label{example:merge_intervals_2:sorting_1}
The quadratic solution presented in Section \ref{example:merge_intervals_2:bruteforce_1} is correct but it does quite a lot of unnecessary work.
When we start examining an not yet excluded interval at index $i$ we are forced to take a look at all the other subsequent intervals in the list because we have no way of knowing whether there will be one with which interval $i$ overlaps with.
However, \textbf{this is not true if the intervals are sorted}. 
Let's assume $I$ is sorted by the $start$ field and that ties between intervals (intervals starting at the same value) are resolved using the $end$ field.
When examining the interval $I_i$ we can simply look at the next interval $I_{i+1}$ and if it does not overlap with $I_i$ then we are sure that none of the elements ahead of it will!
The reason is that in order for interval $I_i$ not to overlap with $I_{i+1}$ it has to be that $I_i.end < I_{i+1}.start$.
Because intervals are sorted by their $start$ fields, any subsequent intervals will have an even higher $start$ value. 
This allows us to save tons of work as we can merge the entire list in linear time once it is sorted. 

Listing \ref{list:merge_intervals_2_nlogn} implements this idea.

\lstinputlisting[language=c++, caption={$nlog(n)$ time solution using sorting.},label=list:merge_intervals_2_nlogn]{sources/merge_intervals_2/merge_intervals_2_merge_entire_list_solution1.cpp}

Not surprisingly, the first thing this code does is sorting the input list.
We then start by pushing the first interval into the output list \inline{ans}.
We keep merging subsequent elements that overlap with \inline{ans.back} until we find one that does not.
At this point, we are sure that whatever interval is in \inline{ans.back} will definitely not overlap with any other interval in the list.
Therefore we can safely push this new interval into \inline{ans} and repeat the process until all intervals have been analyzed.

Notice that here we are using the same \inline{merge} function used in Listing \ref{list:merge_intervals_2_bruteforce};
However, because we know elements are sorted we could simplify the condition \inline{if ((a.start >= b.start && a.start <= b.end) || (b.start >= a.start && b.start <= a.end))} as we know that \inline{a.start <= b.start} is always true.

This approach has a time complexity of $nlog(n)$ (due to the sorting) 
and the space complexity is $O(n)$ (however, we really only use linear spcae to store the output list and if we do not account for it the complexity is constant).

\section{Common Variation - Add a new interval}
\subsection{Problem statement}
\begin{exercise}
\label{example:merge_intervals_2:exercice1_2}
Given a sorted list of disjoint (non-overlapping) intervals $I$ and an interval $w$, insert $w$ into $I$ so that the resulting list still contains only disjoint intervals.
You may assume that the intervals are sorted according to their start times.

	%example1
	\begin{example}
		\label{example:merge_intervals_2:example1}
		\hfill \\
		Given $I=\{(1,3),(6,9)\}$ and $w=(2,5)$ the function returns $I'=\{(1,5),(6,9)\}$ (see Figure \ref{example:merge_intervals_2:example1}).
	\end{example}

	%example2
	\begin{example}
		\label{example:merge_intervals_2:example2}
		\hfill \\
		Given $I=\{(1,2),(3,5),(6,7),(8,10),(12,16)\}$ and $w=(4,9)$ the function returns $I'=\{(1,2),(3,10),(12,16)\}$
	\end{example}

\end{exercise}

\subsection{Discussion}
\label{merge_intervals_2:sec:discussion_1}
This problem is really not that different from the one described in Section \ref{example:merge_intervals_2:exercice1_1} to the point that you can use almost the same approach to tackle this one. In particular, one can think of simply adding $w$ to $I$ and then proceed to use the algorithms described above to solve the problem. This would grant us a $nlog(n)$ solution for this variation with very little effort. 
However, there is really no need to do the extra $log(n)$ work to have the entire $I$ plus $w$ sorted, especially considering that $I$ comes already in a sorted state and we can take advantage of that. 

Let's start by imagining that an oracle would tell us the index $k$ (if exists) of the first interval in $I$ having its end field smaller than $w$'s start field.
Clearly every element before $k$ can be simply copied over into the output list as we are sure they do not overlap with $w$.

What we can do at this point is to insert $w$ in the output list and basically use the same algorithm discussed above for solving the main version of this problem. 
We can do this because we know for a fact that $I_{k+1}$ does not completely fall behing $w$, otherwise we would have had inserted it in the previous step.
Therefore we are left with two options about the relationship between $I_{k+1}.start$ and $w$:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $I_{k+1}.start$ and $w$ overlap;
	\item $w$ falls completely behind $I_{k+1}.start$.
\end{enumerate}
From these facts we can deduce that we are safe at inserting $w$ after having copied element $k$.

At this point all we are left to do is to try and merge $\{w, I_{k+1},I_{k+2},I_{k+2}\ldots \}$, which we can do  using the same approach discussed above (minus the sorting step, of course).

An implementation of this idea is shown in Listing \ref{list:merge_intervals_2}

\lstinputlisting[language=c++, caption={Linear time solution.},label=list:merge_intervals_2]{sources/merge_intervals_2/merge_intervals_2_solution1.cpp}

The code works in two distinct stages represented by the \inline{for} and \inline{while} loops. 
In the first loop statement we take care of finding the location $k$ at which we can insert $w$. 
Notice that $k$ might also be the end of the list and this is why we have the \inline{if(!inserted)} check. If every element of $I$ ends before $w.start$ then we are sure $w$ should be placed at the very end of the output list and there is no more work to be done. 

The second loop, like in Listing \ref{list:merge_intervals_2_nlogn} uses \inline{ans.back} as a working variable to merge $w$ with the rest of the overlapping intervals in $I$. 
When we reach a point $j$ where there is no more element overlapping with \inline{ans.back} then the \inline{else} part of the code will always be executed (as we started off with non-overlapping intervals in $I$) and the remainder of the list gets copied in the output list, completing the exercise.

Both time and space complexities are linear.




\section{Common Variation - How many meeting rooms are needed?}
\subsection{Problem statement}
\begin{exercise}
	\label{example:merge_intervals_2:exercice1_2}
	Given an array of time intervals where each interval $(x,y) \: : x < y$ represent a meeting starting at time $x$ and ending at time $y$(excluded), return the minimum number of conference rooms required to accomodate all meetings.
	
		%example1
		\begin{example}
			\label{example:merge_intervals_2:example1}
			\hfill \\
			Given $I=\{(9,10),(4,9),(5,17)\}$ the function returns $2$. We can schedule $(4,9)$ and $(5,17)$ in two different meeting rooms while $(9,10)$ can be scheduled in the same room of $(4,9)$ after it ends. 
		\end{example}
	
	\end{exercise}
	

\section{Brute-force}
Let's start by noticing that if you have $k$ intervals that are \textbf{all overlapping with each other}, then you need to have $k$ different meeting rooms to accommodate all $k$ meetings.
We can build on this simple observation and calculate the number of concurrent meetings for each and every time unit encompassed by $I$: from the earliest start to the latest end of a meeting in $I$ (or in other words,from the smallest to the largest among all start and end fields of all intervals). 
For instance w.r.t. the Example \ref{example:merge_intervals_2:example1} we know the smallest time among all intervals is $4$ while the largest is $17$.
Therefore there are $t=4-17$ time units for which we need to calculate the number of concurrent meetings. 
Our answer will be the largest among these values.

We can keep an array of size $t$, where index $0$ maps to time $4$, index $1$ to time $5$ and so on up to the last index of the array ($12$) mapping to time $17$,
to store the information about the number of meetings happening at that time.
Such an array can be filled by looping through each and every interval $i=(s_i, e_i)$ in $I$ and incrementing only the cells corrensponding to times from $s_i$ to $e_i$ (the time spanned by the interval $i$). 

Figure \ref{fig:merge_intervals_2:example1} shows how such an array would look like after being filled with the procedure discussed above and using the input of Example \ref{example:merge_intervals_2:example1}. 
We can see how the maximum value there is $2$ signifing that we need at most $2$ meetings rooms to accomodate all meetings.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sources/merge_intervals_2/images/example2_meetings}
	\caption[]{Number of concurrent meetings throughtout the entire time spanned by all intervals in Exampled \ref{example:merge_intervals_2:example1}.}
	\label{fig:merge_intervals_2:example1}
\end{figure}

Listing \ref{list:merge_intervals_2_nlogn} implements this idea. 
The code is pretty straightforward and we can notice how we have a double loop, one looping through the intervals and the second through the time span of a single interval.
We can also notice how we use the variable \inline{shift==-min_hour} to map indices of the array \inline{meeting_at_time} to the actual times in $I$.

\lstinputlisting[language=c++, caption={$O(k^2 + n)$ time and $O(k)$ space solution where $k$ is the time span between the smallest starting  and largest ending time of a meeting.},label=list:merge_intervals_2_nlogn]{sources/merge_intervals_2/meeting_rooms1_solution1.cpp}

The complexity of this approach is $O(k^2 + n)$ where $k$ is the difference between the smallest and largest time among all intervals in $I$ and $n$ is the number of such intervals.
The space complexity is $O(k)$. If $k$ is constant, this is actually not too bad of a solution, but in general, for this problem both $k$ and $n$ can be considered not to have a particularly favorable bound and we need therefore look for a more efficient solution.


\section{$nlog(n)$ - Intervals endpoints}
\label{example:merge_intervals_2:sorting_2}
We can enrich our set of observations about this problem with the fact that, if two meetings overlap, then they must overlap either at the start or at the end of a room's booking interval. This allows us to basically avoid to excplicitelly mark every time unit in a interval and focus only only its endpoints. 
For example in the Example \ref{fig:merge_intervals_2:example1}  we see that interval $(5,17)$ and $(4,9)$ overlaps and also that they start doing so from time $4$ and also that they stop overlapping at time $9$.
Why is this useful for us? Because if we can somehow avoid looking at the entire time spanned by all intervals in $I$ and just look at the endpoints then the running time of such algorithm would be time complexity $O(n)$. 

Let's imagine for a second we have all the $start$ and $end$ fields stored and then sorted in increasing order into two independent arrays, say \inline{startPoints} and \inline{endPoints}, respectively. The idea is to keep track of two separate indices \inline{idxS} and \inline{idxE} pointing to \inline{startPoints} and \inline{endPoints}, respectively, both initialized to zero. We also keep track of the number of concurrent meetings in a variable \inline{concurrentMeetings} also inizialized to zero.
We can then compare \inline{startPoints[idxS]} with \inline{endPoints[idxE]} and:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item if \inline{startPoints[idxS] < endPoints[idxE]} then we can conclude that we have found a start point of a meeting that is happening before the next (in time) end of a meeting. Therefore we need another room: \inline{concurrentMeetings++}
	\item  if, on the other hand, \inline{startPoints[idxS] >= endPoints[idxE]} then we have found that the end of a meeting happens to be before the start pointed by \inline{idxS} and we can decrement \inline{concurrentMeetings}.
\end{enumerate}

This algorithm works because \inline{startPoints} and \inline{endPoints} are sorted for each element of the former there is one that is larger in the latter. This means that \inline{concurrentMeetings} will never be smaller than one in practice after the first iteration (which will always hit the first case above i.e. \inline{startPoints[0] < endPoints[0])}

This idea is implemented in Listing  \ref{list:merge_intervals_2_nlogn_endpoints}. 

\lstinputlisting[language=c++, caption={$O(nlog(n))$ time and $O(1)$ space solution.},label=list:merge_intervals_2_nlogn_endpoints]{sources/merge_intervals_2/meeting_rooms1_solution3.cpp}

The code works by first making sure \inline{startPoints} and \inline{endPoints} are filled and sorted properly. The next step is to loop until we have took a look at each and every element in \inline{startPoints} and increasing the value of the variable \inline{concurrentMeetings} depending on the value of such comparison.

The time and space complexities of this solution are $O(n)$.
