\chapter{Fid the largest gap}
\label{ch:max_gap}
\section*{Introduction}
The problem discussed in the chapter is another one about sorting. Its statement is quite simple and
the only input given is an unsorted array from which we are asked to calculate a value would be
trivial to find if the input was sorted. Therefore, the real challenge of this problem is to come-up
with a solution that does not require explicit sorting.

Particular attention should be paid to the examples as well as to the problem statement because it
is quite easy to misinterpret the real requirements of the function you asked to write if you dive
right away into coding. The problem asks you to return the largest distance between any element in
the input array provided they appear one next to the other when $I$ is sorted. You might
misinterpret the problem by thinking that you need to return the largest distance between any two
elements of the original input array. This interpretation is wrong, and your intuition should make
you aware of it right away considering that the solution to this problem involves only finding the
minimum and the maximum values of the input array. You can expect any coding interview question to
be harder than that. An imagination effort (or some pen and paper work) is thus necessary to
understand each of the examples provided.

\section{Problem statement}
\begin{exercise}
\label{example:max_gap:exercice1}
Write a function that given a unsorted array $I$ of length $n$ returns the largest gap between two
elements that would appear one next to the other  
if $I$ was sorted. A gap between $x$ and $y$ is defined as the absolute value of the difference
between $x$ and $y$: $|x-y|$.

	%example1
	\begin{example}
		\label{example:max_gap:example1}
		\hfill \\
		Given $I = \{5,3,1,8,9,2,4\}$ the function returns $3$. Sorting $I$ changes it into:
		$sort(I)= \{1,2,3,4,5,8,9\}$, and the largest gap between any two consecutive elements is
		$3$. In this case between $5$ and $8$.		
	\end{example}

	%example2
	\begin{example}
		\label{example:max_gap:example2}
		\hfill \\
		Given $I = \{7, 1, 8, 9,15\}$ the function returns $6$. $sort(I)= \{1,7,8,9,15\}$, and the
		largest gap between any two of its consecutive elements is $6$ e.g. between $1$ and $7$ or
		between $15$ and $9$.	
	\end{example}
	
\end{exercise}

\section{Clarification Questions}

\begin{QandA}
	\item Is the input $I$ modifiable?
	\begin{answered}
		\textit{Yes you can modify $I$.}
	\end{answered}

	\item Is any guarantee or constraint on the value of each element of $I$?
	\begin{answered}
		\textit{You can assume each element of $I$ to fit in a signed integer.}
	\end{answered}
	
\end{QandA}

%\section{Discussion} \label{max_gap:sec:discussion}


\section{Trivial Solution}
\label{max_gap:sec:trivial}
As already mentioned in the introduction this problem has an extremely simple solution when we can
afford to get our hands on a sorted version of the input array. In this specific version of the
problem $I$ is not read-only and we are allowed to modify it,therefore, we can sort it directly. If
that is not possible all you have to do is to create a copy of $I$ and sort that instead. 

Given a sorted collection, the largest gap between any two numbers can be find in linear time by
just scanning each pair $p=(I_k, I_{k+1)}$ of subsequent elements and for each of them calculate
their distance $d_k=I_{k-1}-I_k$. Among all calculated distances we just return the largest. Listing
\ref{list:max_gap:bruteforce} shows an implementation of this idea. Notice that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item we do not need to use the absolute value operation as we are operating on a sorted
	collection and therefore, we are guaranteed that $I_{k+1}$ is larger or equal than $I_k$.
	\item the \inline{for} loop stops when $i=|I|-1$ in order to avoid accessing an invalid element
	while executing \inline{I_copy[i+1]}. When $i=|I|-1$ this would lead to accessing the element at index
	$|I|$, which does not exists. In C++ this would cause undefined behaviour, and the most likely
	outcome would be a segmentation fault error.
\end{itemize}
